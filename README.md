## Sevayu
Sevayu Backend is a powerful and innovative platform that aims to solve the problem of hospitals lacking individual websites. Our platform provides a uniform and centralized solution for all hospitals, enabling them to register and showcase their facilities, information, and appointment services in one place â€“ the Sevayu website. Additionally, users can take advantage of the Sevayu Android app to search for nearby hospitals, make inquiries, access hospital details, and book appointments seamlessly.
## Key Features

- **Facilities and Services**: Hospitals can list all the facilities, services, and departments they offer, making it convenient for users to find relevant information.

- **Real-time Consultation**: We integrate Firebase and socket.io to enable real-time consultations, enhancing communication between doctors and patients.

- **Search Functionality**: The Sevayu app provides a robust search feature that allows users to find nearby hospitals based on their preferences.

- **Appointment Booking**: Users can book appointments with their desired doctors or departments through the app, ensuring a seamless experience.
